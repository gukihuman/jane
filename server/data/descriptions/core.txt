Functions like "load" and "getFileName" aid in resource loading and naming, initializing the game environment with essential data and assets.

core\start.ts: This TypeScript module serves as a Nuxt.js plugin responsible for initializing various game aspects when the application mounts. It includes functions for starting the app, configuring settings, creating the hero character, setting up game systems, and managing events. This module ensures the game is ready for interaction and gameplay after application initialization.
