core\load.ts: This file handles the loading of game assets and data, utilizing external libraries and an asynchronous Nuxt plugin. It efficiently loads resources from various paths using glob patterns and populates data structures like MODELS, ITEMS, SKILLS, SCENE, and ASSETS. It also manages naming conventions and formats for loaded items, ensuring their proper structuring for the game.

core\start.ts: This file is integral to game development, focusing on setup and initialization. It configures and initializes core game components upon application mounting. It checks for a viewport, sets development mode flags, and initializes key components such as CONFIG, WORLD, HERO, EVENTS, SETTINGS, LOCAL, INVENTORY, INTERFACE, EFFECTS, and GLOBAL. Additionally, it handles the creation of game entities like the hero character and event listeners. The 'setupSystems' function initializes game systems based on priority order, likely for game logic.

core\WORLD.ts: This TypeScript class, named "World," is a fundamental part of a game engine or application. It manages the game world, including rendering and logic. It contains properties like the PIXI.js Application instance for rendering, an entity map, and game logic systems. The "init" method sets up the game world, configuring the PIXI Application, layer containers, and entity sorting. The "loop" object manages the game loop, including frame rate control and elapsed time tracking. This class forms the core for game world management, rendering, and game logic.
